The Flemish Priorities Map provides an overview of the most important watercourses for fish populations, with the priority of each watercourse determining the deadline by which it must be free of barriers. The Leie Diversion Canal (Afleidingskanaal van de Leie: AKL) is designated as a watercourse with priority 2, meaning that the lock and weir complexes in Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk must be fish-passable by 2021 or at the latest by 2027.

The goal of this study was to assess the extent of inland migration in the AKL and determine whether the lock and weir complexes in Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk allow fish passage.

Various capture methods were used to sample fish populations: In Balgerhoeke, downstream from the lock and weir complex, traps, substrates, and an eel ladder were used to catch, identify, and mark fish (to determine whether individuals accumulated before the barrier or reached Schipdonk). In Schipdonk, downstream from the lock and weir complex and the siphon, traps and substrates were used to catch and identify fish.

The current study confirms that the lock and weir complex at Balgerhoeke acts as a complete fish barrier, necessitating adjustments to make it fish-passable. No fish marked in Balgerhoeke were captured downstream in Schipdonk. Additionally, elvers (young eels) were only found downstream of the Balgerhoeke barrier. This indicates that young eels migrating upstream enter the Zeebrugge sluice complex, likely due to the adustjed tidal barrier management, and move through the Zeebrugge-Balgerhoeke section up to the barrier but cannot proceed further. To restore the vulnerable eel population, it is crucial for young eels to access suitable inland habitats as efficiently as possible. Eels reaching the Groot Pand via the AKL would gain access to the Scheldt and Leie river habitats, benefiting the population. While increased connectivity would offer other fish species a wider choice of habitats and an escape from temporary local suboptimal conditions (such as drought and oxygen deficiency), the added value appears less significant than for eels. Notably, stone perch and perch ready for spawning were not recaptured near the barrier, suggesting they turn around and spawn further downstream (where suitable spawning habitat seems to be present based on visual assessment). Furthermore, despite varying relative abundances, practically the same species occur both upstream and downstream of the Balgerhoeke barrier, indicating minimal change in species richness due to increased connectivity.

Removal of the barrier at Balgerhoeke is preferable from an ecological perspective because it imitates the most natural situation that can be achieved, but it does mean an increased risk of dike damage and an end to pleasure boating. Fish passages are an option when barrier removal is not possible, but they pose several logistical challenges and remain a challenge for many fish to pass. A basin fish ladder allows the passage of many species in both directions, but requires a certain minimum flow to function properly and to provide a sufficiently strong attracting current. As the name of the AKL suggests, the canal mainly plays a role in diverting or transporting excess water once the requirements for the minimum flow of the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal and the Sea Scheldt have been met. Current flows are low and sporadic, especially during summer, which is suboptimal for fishway operation. An eel flume has lower hydraulic requirements than a basin fish ladder and is therefore more likely to succeed under current conditions, but only works for upstream migrating eels. Given the potential of the AKL for upstream eel migration, thanks to the adapted drainage management at Zeebrugge, eel channels at Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk would be the minimum requirement to make the barriers "eel-passable".
