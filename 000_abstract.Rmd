The Flemish priority map lists the main watercourses with bottlenecks for which the removal of the bottlenecks will benefit the fish stock. The priority of the watercourse determines the deadline by which it must be free of bottlenecks. The River Lys Diversion Canal (AKL) is designated as a watercourse with priority 2 which means that the lock complexes in Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk should be fish passable by 2021 or at the latest by 2027.

The aim of this study was to assess the extent of inland fish migration in the AKL and whether the lock weir complexes in Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk are fish-passable in an upstream direction.

Different trapping methods were used to sample fish populations: In Balgerhoeke, downstream of the lock weir complex, traps, substrates and an eel flume were used to catch, identify and tag fish (so that it could be determined whether individuals accumulated in front of the barrier or reached Schipdonk). In Schipdonk, downstream of the lock weir complex and siphon, traps and substrates were used to catch and identify fish.

Previous research by INBO showed that the application of adapted sluice management in Zeebrugge is a very effective and cost-efficient management measure to allow glass eels to enter the Zeebrugge Balgerhoeke property of the Leie Diversion Canal [@buysse2015]. The capture of numerous juvenile eels (elvers) in Balgerhoeke now also shows that glass eels also find suitable juvenile habitat in this channel and migrate inland and thus upstream through the Zeebrugge-Balgerhoeke property up to the first potential barrier: the lock weir complex in Balgerhoeke. However, the current study now also shows that the lock weir complex in Balgerhoeke is an absolute barrier to the further upstream migration of juvenile eels but also for all other fish species. Indeed, in the upstream property, no juvenile eels (elvers) were caught at any trapping site, nor were any fish recaptured in Schipdonk that were previously tagged in the downstream property in Balgerhoeke. The results show that modifications are needed to make the lock weir complex in Balgerhoeke fish-passable. Further upstream spread is prevented by the lock weir complex at Balgerhoeke. As eels do not reach Schipdonk, its passability for eels could not be investigated. However, the concentration of spawning fish species such as perch and roach downstream of both Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk complexes suggest that the complex at Schipdonk is also an important barrier for all fish species. Thus, to achieve connectivity with the Great Pledge, both barriers need to be addressed.

The eel is listed as a critically endangered fish species on the IUCN Red List. To restore the vulnerable eel population, completion of their catadromous life cycle is crucial. To this end, juvenile eel must be able to reach as many quality juvenile and foraging areas as possible in the Scheldt river basin in the most efficient way possible. Eels must be able to reach the Groot Pand via the AKL to access those habitats in the Scheldt and the Leie which would benefit the population. The results now also effectively show that the AKL is an entry route for upstream migrating eels towards the Scheldt river basin. This is also why the AKL was included with priority 2 in the fish migration priority map and improved connectivity is needed [@stevens2009].

For other fish species, increased connectivity would mean greater availability of different habitats and could provide an escape route for any temporary local unfavourable or suboptimal conditions (e.g. during prolonged drought and high atmospheric temperature, temperature stress and/or oxygen depletion may occur). However, when all factors are considered, rehabilitation of the bottlenecks in this channel seems slightly less crucial for these species than for eels, as most of these species can also complete their life cycle within a single channel wall. For example, spawning juvenile pos and perch were not recaptured after ‘marking’ at the level of the barrier suggesting that they turn around and spawn more downstream. In addition, despite different relative numbers, the same species occur upstream and downstream of the barrier at Balgerhoeke indicating that species richness would change little to nothing due to increased connectivity. However, total biomass would likely increase due to a greater variety of available habitats and a more balanced ecosystem.

**Remediation solutions**

When remediating fish migration bottlenecks, it is generally stated that the restoration of natural dynamics (and structural diversity) whereby the watercourse is redesigned with a natural gradient (without constructions) is preferred. Purely from an ecological perspective, and despite the fact that the AKL is an artificially dug watercourse with limited dynamics, the removal of barriers in Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk is preferred as this is the best way to achieve longitudinal connectivity as a function of both free upstream and downstream fish migration. The function of the weirs on the AKL in terms of water management and of the locks (e.g. the disused lock in Balgerhoeke) should be evaluated by the water manager. If (partial) removal of the structures is not feasible or desirable, migration-promoting, technical structures (fish passages) should be constructed.

It is strongly recommended to work with the Hydraulic Laboratory (WL) to review the technical options to achieve connectivity. This report aimed to determine the fish passability of the sluice gate complexes at Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk and provides an impetus for remediation solutions, but an in-depth analysis of the requirements (such as available flow) and expected efficiency of a fish passage at Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk is lacking. Removal of the barrier at Balgerhoeke is preferred from an ecological perspective because it mimics the most natural situation achievable, but it does mean an increased risk of dike damage and a restriction to pleasure boating.

Technical fish passages are an option when barrier removal is not possible, but they present several logistic challenges and remain a challenge for many fish to pass. A De Wit fish passage allows passage of many species but requires a certain minimum flow rate to function properly and to provide a sufficiently strong bait flow. During the study period, the average flow rate was higher than the minimum requirement for a De Wit fish passage and generally, during spring and autumn, sufficient water is likely to be available each time for a technical fish passage to function. However, as the name of the AKL suggests, the canal mainly plays a role in diverting or removing excess water once the minimum flow requirements of the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal and the Zeeschelde have been met. Current flows are therefore sporadic and during summer may even be too low for optimal operation of a fish passage. A more continuous flow would not only benefit the fish passage but also the migration in the property itself because of the less stunted nature of the flow course.

If neither barrier removal nor the construction of a technical fish passage proves possible, the eel channel is a third alternative. An eel flume has lower hydraulic requirements and is therefore probably the simplest solution, but it only works for upstream migrating eel. Given the potential of the AKL for upstream eel migration, thanks to the adapted sluice management at Zeebrugge, eel flumes at Balgerhoeke and Schipdonk would be the minimum requirement to make the barriers ‘eel-passable’.
